-- The endpoints and their functionalities that you need to create are as follows:
-- 1) /add -> POST Method -> This route should add the data sent with the request body into the post.json file.
-- Sample data sent with the request:
```  {
    "id": "1",
    "name": "updated name",
    "age": "22",
    "gender": "Male",
    "email": "userone@gmail.com"
}
```
- If the data is added successfully, then you should sent a response code of 200.

- 2) /view -> GET Method -> This route has a optional query param called id. If no query param get passed with the request then you should fetch all the data from the get.json file.

- /view

- Expected response:
```
  [ {

    "age": "22",
    "gender": "Male",
